# 🧮 NumPy Tutorial + Mini Project: Company Sales Analysis

Welcome to this beginner-friendly NumPy tutorial for data science learners.  
This guide introduces NumPy basics and then walks you through a mini project where you analyze a company’s sales data using NumPy.

--What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for:

- Handling large datasets efficiently
- Performing mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra operations,  
- Forming the foundation for libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
In data science, NumPy is used for data analysis, cleaning, transformation, and machine learning computations.

--Why NumPy instead of Python Lists?

✅ Faster and more memory-efficient  
✅ Supports vectorized operations (no need for loops)  
✅ Built-in mathematical & statistical functions  
✅ Handles multi-dimensional data (matrices, tensors, images)

▶️ How to Run   
    Clone this repository   
  ✅ git clone https://github.com/gargswati12/NumPyTutorial.git   
  ✅ cd NumPyTutorial   
  ✅ Create a virtual environment (recommended)   
  ✅ python -m venv venv   
  ✅ source venv/bin/activate      # On Mac/Linux   
  ✅ venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows   
  ✅ Install NumPy     
  ✅ pip install numpy     
  ✅ Run the script: python sales_analysis.py   
  ✅ Enter sales data when prompted and see the analysis results.   
     
--What we will do here:   
   
We’ll analyze a company’s monthly sales data. The program will:   
✅ Take sales input from the user (for 12 months).   
✅ Calculate total, average, highest, and lowest sales.   
✅ Find the best and worst performing months.   
✅ Show months with above/below average performance.
